# Overview & Demo

### Compare Dropdown (Initial State)

The animation demonstrates the initial state of the compare dropdown.  
This feature provides users with a dedicated space to add products they wish to compare.  
While currently empty, the dropdown dynamically updates as items are selected, displaying product thumbnails for quick previews.

This intuitive interface ensures a seamless comparison experience by keeping selected products easily accessible in one place.  
Further functionality, such as adding and removing items, will be showcased in subsequent steps.

It also highlights how the application dynamically updates based on user interactions, providing real-time feedback.
